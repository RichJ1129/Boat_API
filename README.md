## Data Model

- User
    Property Type Required? Valid Values

```
JWT JSON Web Token Yes JWT generated by
Google Oauth
```
```
Unique ID String Yes Sub of JWT
```
- Boat
    Property Type Required Valid Values

```
ID String Yes Automatically created
by DataStore.
```
```
Name String Yes Name of the boat.
E.g. “VIII Rings”
```
```
Type String Yes Can be any string,
should be descriptive.
E.g. “yacht”
```
```
Length Integer Yes Any integer is
acceptable. Allowance
of integers as string
but not
recommended.
```
```
Loads String No ID of Load Model.
```
```
Owner Unique ID of User
Model (String)
```
```
Yes Must be a User Model
that has already been
created.
```

- Load
    Property Type Required Valid Values

```
ID String Yes Automatically
created by
DataStore.
```
```
Weight Integer Yes Any integer is
acceptable.
Allowance of integers
as string but not
recommended.
```
```
Content String Yes Content of the load.
```
```
Delivery Date String Yes String in the format
of “mm/dd/yyyy”.
```
```
Boats String No ID of boat model.
```
- The Boat and Load are the two non-user entities. The boat has the ability to have zero or more
    loads on it, but the load can only be on one boat at a given time. To put a load on another boat
    it will require unlinking the load from the boat and placing it on another boat.
- The unique identifier for the users in my data model is the sub of the json web token. If a
    request needs to supply a user identifier the JWT must be supplied. While the JWT is generated
    the Unique ID is also generated. The User is only related to the Boat in which the boat is owned
    by the User, this is accomplished by having the boat have an owner property.
